## Photography
Welcome to the photography section!

The first time I took pictures, it was on a disposable camera I found in a closet. I didn't know there was film, so I pretend took pictures. When my dad developed it, he found pictures of hosue objects and my brothers. I now have an interchangeable lens camera (alpha 2000), and have since improved (I hope) my picture taking and editing skills.

I take pictures of mostly nature, but if something catches my eye I'll take ones of anything. The focus of the picture can change: sometimes it's to capture what I saw, sometimes it is to add some artistic flair. You can decide. Any of the links below will take you to my posts.
