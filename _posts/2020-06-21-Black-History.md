Our education system often misses lots of history, especially black history. To educate yourself on more of that, read below.

## Murders

#### The Wrightsville 21
On  March 5th, 1959, 69 African American boys aged 13-17 were locked into their room at the Negro Boys Industrial School in Wrightsville. It mysteriously ignited in the middle of the night, and while many managed to escape, it is believed 21 burned alive inside it.
This brought attention to the horrible conditions they lived in such as cramped spaces and having buckets as their bathrooms.
> "The boys in the school were committed for being orphaned, homeless or for committing offenses described as mischief and alleged petty crimes. The school and the treatment of the children became a fiery representation of segregation within the South during the Jim Crow Era." (Brooks, 2017)

The estates of each boy were supposed to receive $2500 in compensation, but one family says they only got $1400. And no one was indicted.

## Whitewashed History

#### Alexander Hamilton
His mother Rachel Faucette was mixed race (hiding her true ethnicity on documents). His older brother was darker and treated as black. He was light enough to pass.

#### Beethoven 
His mother was an African Muslim, and all descriptions are of him having dark skin

#### Betty Boop
Based on the black singer Esther "Baby Esther" Jones and the baby voice she used when singing songs like "I Wanna Be Loved by You (Boop-Boop-Be-Doo)".

#### Queen Charlotte
Descended from a black and Asian branch of the Portuguese Royal House. British history "accidentally" concealed this.

#### Cleopatra
A Greek Egyptian, she was brown.

#### Jesus 
He was Jewish, middle-eastern, and born in Israel. He definitely wouldn't be the white man often depicted.

#### Santa
Based off a Turkish man named St. Nick.
