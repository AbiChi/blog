## Film-Makers
- Spike Lee
Highlighted black culture. His films are categorized by their poignancy, as they are unapologetic in their reflection of the social contexts surrounding them. "His work examines both the relationship between the black community and the world around it and, more introspectively, the relationship of the black community to itself" (heartbrokenzine). He has redefined the media's understanding of race-based social and political issues like colorism and poverty.
Some of his style touches are frequent use of double dolly shots and a signature catch-phrase to close out his movies.
