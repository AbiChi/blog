This is one type of photograph that I don't do often, but I'm trying to do more. My subjects will most likely just be me or family unless I get that person's permission to post them.

## Self - Portraits (9/10/17)
This is one of my favorite spots at the MN Zoo.

## Animals

#### JC33 (10/6/19)
JC33, I call him Jack (I misread it as J3CC, which sounds like Jack) is a tagged goose I periodically see at a nearby lake. He likes getting his picture taken, and this is my favorite portrait-like photo of him.
