I like all the photos I post here, but there are just some I *really* love, so I'm putting those here. They're ones that in the future I might print them on canvas.

### Mussel Bird (3/6/20)
I'm not sure what this is actually called, but it loves to run along the water's edge looking for tiny mussels to eat.
