So much of popular culture we have the Black community to thank. Here are just some of the many.

## Fashion

#### Hair
There was a natural hair movement in the 60s, but it fails to show in the model world. Black models often have straightened or shaved hair. One root of this is that hairdressers are uneducated on black hair. This forces models to do their own hair or assimilate to non-black hair. If you wear your natural hair you're "labeled as being difficult to work with," says Ebonee Davis, a black fashion model.

#### The Bucket Hat
These were originally used by irish farmers and fishermen in the 1900s to shield from the rain. Then a stiffer version was worn as a ladies accessory in the 1960s.
In the 1980s, the hip hop community introduced it as a street style. Big Bank Hank is said to be the first celebrity to show it off in 1979, followed by Jay Z.
Now it can seen on runways with brands like Fendi and Prada.

#### Chunky Jewelry & Gold Hoops
This can go all the way back to 2500 BC Sumerian women and pirates in the 1650s. Fast forward, gold hoops became popular as streetwear in the 60s as a part of the black power movement. From then on, gold hoops and other chunky jewelry were prominent in the hip hop and rap scenes.
The hoops represented freedom, gave a sense of unity, and became integral to black culture.

#### High-End Streetwear
Examples are sneakers or tracksuit pants. It was first snubbed by big designers like Tommy Hilfiger and Chanel, leading to increased popularity of black-owned brands like [Cross Colours](https://crosscolours.com/), FUBU, and [Kari Kani](https://www.karlkani.com/). Then white-owned brands like TH and Ralph Lauren hopped on the bandwagon.

#### Lettuce Hem
Often seen today in fashion stores, it was created by black designer Stephen Burrows in the 70s. He came up with the overcast hem to give a ruffled effect. 

#### Nail Art
Long nails are a common thing now, but they originate in Egypt and have been a part of the Black community since the 80s. It was brought to the attention of main media after Florence Griffith-joyner wore 4 inch nails as she broke the 100 metres world record at the US olympics track field. These were long and bright, compared to the white community's french manicure and pastel colors.
Originally ridiculed and called "ghetto", they are now more associated with the Karsdashians than the black women who started the trend.

#### Sneaker Culture
In the 1970s, New Yorkers involved in basketball and the hiphop community created the culture. They were mostly kids of color.
Sneakers have played a prominent role in black urban culture. The appropriation of it by white people is discussed in the documentary "Fresh Dressed". [Here](https://www.amazon.com/Fresh-Dressed-Damon-Dash/dp/B06XJ3TZGT) it is on amazon.

#### Spray Paint Customization
Started in the 90s by black trendsetters. It was then seen in music videos and tv shows. Spray painting has been used to express creativity and statements in clothing. 
White-owned brands ike dolce, Gabanna, and dolls kill have been profiting off the trend. They are notoriously anti-black, yet seek to profit off the trend anyway.
