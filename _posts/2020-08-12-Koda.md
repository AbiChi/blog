I got Koda (named after Koda from Disney's Brother Bear) on July 25, 2020 as a kitten. I will be putting my favorite photos of him here.

## Kitten Days (< 12 months)

He seems to be able to sleep anywhere, and one time he fell asleep on the floor. There was some moody lighting though, and that's how I got this picture.

He's got these big ears, and sometimes he reminds me of "The Child" or Baby Yoda from the Disney show Mandalorian (and his name rhymes). This one is where I think he looked most like the alien baby.

Oftentimes he wants to be near me but I'm working (on my laptop), so he'll sit patiently beside me and take a nap. He always looks so peaceful. I have a lot of pictures of him sleeping, I just thought this one focused particularly well.
