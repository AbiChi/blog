Our education system often misses lots of history, especially black history. To educate yourself on more of that, read below.

## Murders & Massacres

#### The Wrightsville 21
On  March 5th, 1959, 69 African American boys aged 13-17 were locked into their room at the Negro Boys Industrial School in Wrightsville. It mysteriously ignited in the middle of the night, and while many managed to escape, it is believed 21 burned alive inside it.
This brought attention to the horrible conditions they lived in such as cramped spaces and having buckets as their bathrooms.
> "The boys in the school were committed for being orphaned, homeless or for committing offenses described as mischief and alleged petty crimes. The school and the treatment of the children became a fiery representation of segregation within the South during the Jim Crow Era." (Brooks, 2017)

The estates of each boy were supposed to receive $2500 in compensation, but one family says they only got $1400. And no one was indicted.

#### The Day Philly Bombed Itself
In 1985, the police of Philadelphia and MOVE were fighting. Water cannons, tear gas, and 10,000 round of bullets were used. Then they dropped a satchel bomb (demolition device usually used in combat) laced with Tovex and C-4 explosives on MOVE: a black liberations group. The organization was occupied by men, women, *and* children.
Eleven people were killed, 5 being children, and one being the founder of MOVE. Sixty-one homes were destroyed, and 250+ people were left homeless. Only two members of MOVE survived, one a child, the other Ramona Lacks who was sent to jail for 7 years. That makes her the only person to face charges from the bombing.
MOVE was anti-government, anti-technology, and anti-corporation.
> "Its creator, John Africa, born Vincent Leaphart, was a West Philadelphia native and Korean War veteran whose ideology combined black revolutionary ideas with environmental and animal rights, as well as a back-to-nature movement" ([Vox.com](https://www.vox.com/)).

#### The Tulsa Massacre
Before wallstreet, there was The Greenwood District, or "Black Wallstreet". This district in Oklahoma was a community of 300+ black-owned businesses.
Tensions became high between the white people of Tulsa and this community. The catalyst was when in 1921 a white female accused a black teenager Dick Roland of assault. Without evidence, black and white protestors gathered outside the courthouse Dick was being held at. At some point shots were fired. The next day a white mob stormed Greenwood.

They burned 1,200 homes, causing at least 300 lives to be lost.

## Whitewashed History

#### Alexander Hamilton
His mother Rachel Faucette was mixed race (hiding her true ethnicity on documents). His older brother was darker and treated as black. He was light enough to pass.

#### Beethoven 
His mother was an African Muslim, and all descriptions are of him having dark skin

#### Betty Boop
Based on the black singer Esther "Baby Esther" Jones and the baby voice she used when singing songs like "I Wanna Be Loved by You (Boop-Boop-Be-Doo)".

#### Queen Charlotte
Descended from a black and Asian branch of the Portuguese Royal House. British history "accidentally" concealed this.

#### Cleopatra
A Greek Egyptian, she was brown.

#### Jesus 
He was Jewish, middle-eastern, and born in Israel. He definitely wouldn't be the white man often depicted.

#### Santa
Based off a Turkish man named St. Nick.

## Other Injustices Against Black People in History

#### Senneca Village
A thriving community of African American land owners in the mid 19th century. It was located in a place we now know as central park.
The city of NY wanted to create a park in Manhattan, but since it was full, they used eminent domain to take ownership of the land. This led to residents being forced to move, getting rid of Senneca village.
