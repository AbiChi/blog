## Unclear/Maybe Not
I put these here because I either didn't see any mention of devices or it's unclear whether the devices they distributed during in-person learning will be distributed in the case of deciding fully online learning or to all grade levels. Let me know if you find out they are/aren't issuing devices.

# Emails
Feel free to edit these, it's better if they're personalized!
## To School Boards that aren't/might not be providing Tech
I think the reason they aren't is probably for economic reasons, which is the whole other problem, but in case you want to send an email, continue on. Otherwise you can go straight to emailing your state representatives.

#### Email
To **District** School Board Members,
As a concerned Minnesota citizen, I would like to know why you haven't stated if you will have the opportunity for your less fortunate students to have access to a laptop, tablet, and/or wifi in the case that they don't have access to one at home during distance learning. This is worrying that this could lead to students being left behind, possibly missing a year of their learning that those fortunate to have a laptop and wifi will be receiving. Few resources are listed that might be of any use to supplement. This is a matter of the future of your citizens, I plead you to do everything in your power to do what's best for them.

## To State Representatives

To make it easier, I used [democracy.io](https://democracy.io/#!/) to find my representatives based on my address and sent them an email all at once. Definitely recommend!

#### Email
To **District** House Members,
As a Minnesota citizen, I am concerned for the accessibility for all of our students. In the case of fully online learning, not all households have a device or fast internet to access their online school materials. This could cause a bigger gap between those who can afford those things and cannot. All students need equitable access to technology so that no child is left behind because of this pandemic. I please ask that you get more funding to schools that cannot afford to get devices to their less fortunate students (like Brooklyn Center School District), and resources to get more affordable internet during these times. This is a matter of the future of your people, I plead you to do everything in your power to do what's best for them.
