I like to take pictures of animals, and most of the time I get shots where they're adorable, graceful, and beautiful. But sometimes...the timing is just right so they don't look so much that way.

## Woodland Mammals

This is a squirrel I saw eating in my front yard. It didn't know I could see it through my window and had assumed it was safe. This means it didn't need to be ready to bolt, so it lazily laid on its stomach to eat some seeds.

In another post [Baby Raccoons In Our Garbage](/blog/Photography/Baby-Raccoons-In-Our-Garbage/), where there's some more pictures I got of the babies. I also got a picture where one had its tongue out though, which I think is adorable but also funny.

## Birbs

Here is I think a type of sparrow, and it reminds me of nyoom memes, so here you go.
