One issue is Police Brutality and its discrimination towards black people. There is something deeply wrong with our police force as it is, and some information on that I've put here.

## History

#### Walter Francis White

Walter was a Black man with blond hair and blue eyes. His parents were born into slavery. In 1920 he used his ability to pass for white to infiltrate the KKK to investigate lynchings for the NAACP.

The police of Oklahoma were there. Convinced he was white, they swore him in as a sheriff's deputy.

He was told upon being sworn in, "Now you can go out and shoot any n***** you see and the law'll be behind you".

10 years of evidence for 41 lynchings and 8 race riots still never brought any convictions.
