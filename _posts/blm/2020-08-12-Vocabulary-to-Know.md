In the face of racial justice, discussion is bound to occur. It's important to know words that you might not have heard of before to discuss and understand these issues. It's easy for misinformation to spread, so I've put some of that vocab here for clarification.

## "Systematic" vs "Systemic"

#### Systematic
Something that occurs due to a system.
It relates to an actions resulting from an organized system or method. It can be intentional or unintentional, but is so common that it seems to be the result of a  system.
##### Example: Leaving the house and every time forgetting to lock your door could be a part of a *systematic* pattern of forgetfulness.
#### Systemic (the one we use)
Describes something *inside* a system that affects all parts of that system. It can also be a trait that's "deeply ingrained in the system". This is usually the definition when used in social/political situations.
##### Example: *systemic* cancer would be throughout the body.
