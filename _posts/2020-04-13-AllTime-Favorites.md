I like all the photos I post here, but there are just some I *really* love, so I'm putting those here. They're ones that in the future I might print them on canvas.

### Deer in a Snowstorm (4/13/20)
I remember I saw the deer running past my window and I went out to find them. It was snowing which gave the picture a painting look.

### Tree from Within it (3/8/20)
Right before CoVID-19, I was in CA visiting my grandparents. There is a park near their house, and I visited it to get out by myself once in a while. I have always liked climbing, and so when I saw this tree I knew I wanted to climb up there. When I got to the top, I took this picture. It's just really nice looking due to the centering, and I love nature. Plus it's connected to my favorite place in the world.

### Bee on a flower (3/6/20)
I took this with my grandfather's camera, I love this because it's focused on the bee, and it's really clear
