I love taking panoramas to get a more complete view of places, so here they are.

### Wall Drug (8/17/19)
BC (before corona), my family and I went on a road trip to South Dakota for the second time. Like last time we stopped at Wall Drug: a huge "drug store". It's made of a whole bunch of stores, and there's some fun things to see.

### FIRST Robotics Competition (5/19/18)
I was on a FIRST Robotics team for 4 years. This was when we participated in the state competition at the University of Minnesota. This meant that the stage as well as the pits (where teams work on their robot) were in the same area.

### TCF @ a UFC Game (3/17/18)
I used to go to MN United games, and one of the first I went to, I just loved the stadium, so I took a panorama.

### A view in CO (3/11/18)
Back in 2018 I was trying to figure out where I wanted to go to college, and I loved CO. I didn't end up there, but the trip out there was still fun.

### Krispy Kreme Belt (8/19/17)
When my oldest younger brother and I were younger, we would go to Krispy Kreme where we'd watch as the donuts were freshly made on their crazy machine. I would just get plain glazed (still do), but unfortunately, they closed all the KKs a long time ago.

### Disney World Animal Park (12/21/15)
This was on a vacation I went on. My family always makes sure to include something animal-related because I have always loved animals.
