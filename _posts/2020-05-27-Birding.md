The most common animals I spot are birds, so my favorites of those will be here.

### Blue Heron Taking Off (5/27/20)
I am always looking for this one in my area, so I've named them "Waldo"s, but really they're blue herons. This one was taking off as I took this picture. You can really tell why they're called blue herons.

### Mallard Babies (5/27/20)
May was the time for baby birds, and I got a lot of pictures, this was a good one though. They are baby mallard ducks.

### Bird of Prey Surveilling (5/19/20)
I'm not sure what this is, my guess is an osprey.

### Mourning Dove (4/13/20)
Against the icy sky and the tree in the background, it's just a beautiful picture.

### Blackbird People-Watching (3/7/20)
I visited the Fashion Island (outdoor mall) in Orange County like I usually would with my family (I had gone alone this time). There were birds looking for crumbs as usual, so I took some pictures. This was my favorite because it looks like she's watching people like people would watch people.

### Hummingbird (3/6/20)
One of my grandfather's favorite pastimes is feeding the neighborhood hummingbirds. When I was out there I would sit in the backyard and listen and watch for them.

### Mussel Bird (3/6/20)
I'm not sure what this is actually called, but it loves to run along the water's edge looking for tiny mussels to eat.

### Little Birb (9/29/19)
On the University of Minnesota campus, we have a stadium that birds run into all the time. In the winter this can be bad though, as the birds can then freeze to death. My best friend and I found this one still breathing, and because it made me sad he walked all the way to his car to get gloves and place it in the bushes. Hope it got out of there

### JC33 (10/6/19)
JC33, I call him Jack (I misread it as J3CC, which sounds like Jack) is a tagged goose I periodically see at a nearby lake. He likes getting his picture taken, and this is my favorite portrait-like photo of him.
