This is the title page, you will have to click for the full 14 pages (pdf form).

This is a guide I wrote for a University of Minnesota group I am a codirector of (SASE Labs at [SASE UMN](https://saseumn.org/)). It talks about the basics of the software [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and other beginner coding concepts needed to use MATLAB. This is a prequisite for learning other more complex skills in the software that I will be leading workshops for.

*Note: You will get more out of it if you use it electronically. There are many links for further reading on the topics than I go into in the document.*
