## Murders

#### The Wrightsville 21
On  March 5th, 1959, 69 African American boys aged 13-17 were locked into their room at the Negro Boys Industrial School in Wrightsville. It mysteriously ignited in the middle of the night, and while many managed to escape, it is believed 21 burned alive inside it.
This brought attention to the horrible conditions they lived in such as cramped spaces and having buckets as their bathrooms.
> "The boys in the school were committed for being orphaned, homeless or for committing offenses described as mischief and alleged petty crimes. The school and the treatment of the children became a fiery representation of segregation within the South during the Jim Crow Era." (Brooks, 2017)
The estates of each boy were supposed to receive $2500 in compensation, but one family says they only got $1400. And no one was indicted.
