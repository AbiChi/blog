I'm a sucker for rain, snow, and storms, so I'll be putting the pictures I take not in sunshine here.

### Blurred Deer During Snow in the Woods (4/13/20)
The camera focused on the foreground, but it makes for a pretty picture.

### Deer in a Snowstorm (4/13/20)
I remember I saw the deer running past my window and I went out to find them. It was snowing which gave the picture a painting look.

### Rain in CA (3/12/20)
This doesn't happen often, so I didn't mind not being able to go out. I like rain anyway, and it gave me a day to rest.

### A Frozen Mississippi River (2/13/20)
On campus, my favorite view is when I walk across the bridge and see the river. On a very cold day, not only was the river covered in ice, but there was wisps flying around in the wind.
