So I looked out my window as I do, and I saw a cream-colored animal eating outside. That happens to be the same color as my new kitten, so I had a split-second heart attack that he'd gotten out and was now eating the grain the neighborhood bird lady had tossed out. After seeing Koda was right next to me, I went to go take a closer look. It ended up being an albino raccoon, and I was able to get some pictures.

This one had pretty diffused lighting, they were looking at me, taking a break from digging into the tree.

In this one they were looking at my brother who I'd called to see them. I like how you can really see the pointed snout and how it's tail pokes around the branch.

Probably the cutest, they were all gathered up so they looked very fluffy and smol.

This is my favorite, because I'm a sucker for sitting animals.
