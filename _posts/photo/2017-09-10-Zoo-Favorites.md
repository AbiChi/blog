I love animals, and some of the coolest ones I have access to are at zoo. I've put some of my favorites here.

## MN Zoo

#### Red Panda (9/10/17)
I just love red pandas (they're not even pandas). They're cute, have beautiful coloring, are from Asia, and have a misleading name. This one I got was timed perfectly, and it just looks so picturesque.

Bonus one that isn't as good, but they're tongue is also sticking out.

#### Baby Monkey (9/10/17)
They were messing with stuff in the grass, I just liked this moment where it looks like they're lost in thought.
