## About this blog
Here I will document random resources of interest made by me (Abigail Chiaokhiao).

Right now I just have posts on science and photography, so feel free to navigate to those pages and then the posts from there.

All views expressed are entirely my own.

## About me
Apart from being a Bioproducts & Biosytems Engineering student, I have a passion for coding (I'm pursuing a minor in Computer Science), which created this site. I have always loved many science related topics and the environment. Apart from my education I love to take photographs, have healthy habits, and spend time with my family.

More about me on my [personal website](http://abichi.github.io).
