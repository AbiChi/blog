## About this blog
Here I will document random resources of interest made by me (Abigail Chiaokhiao).

The different categories can be found in the hamburger menu in the upper left, feel free to explore!

All views expressed are entirely my own unless otherwise given credit.

## About me
Apart from being a Bioproducts & Biosytems Engineering student, I have a passion for coding (I'm pursuing a minor in Computer Science), which created this site. I have always loved many science related topics and the environment. Apart from my education I love to take photographs, have healthy habits, and spend time with my family.

More about me on my [personal website](http://abichi.github.io).
