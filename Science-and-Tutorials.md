## Science and Tutorials
Welcome to the science and tutorials section!

Ever since I was young, I've always been captivated by science. Ecology, biology, chemistry, computer science - I love it all. There's so much to learn and sometimes I like to go out of my major. In addition to that, I love spreading that knowledge, especially if it's a skill, and I've made some tutorials in the past, so some will be here.
