## Science and Tutorials
Welcome to the science and tutorials section!

Ever since I was young, I've always been captivated by science. Ecology, biology, chemistry, computer science - I love it all. There's so much to learn and sometimes I like to go out of my major. In addition to that, I love spreading that knowledge, especially if it's a skill, and I've made some tutorials in the past, so some will be here.

### Science Posts
Since my major is Bioproducts & Biosystems Engineering, most of these will be related to that and other classes I've taken at The [University of Minnesota - Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). Hope they can be a resource!

#### BBE
[BBE 1002 Unit 1 - Climate Change, Renewables, & Our Consumption](/blog/Science-and-Tutorials/BBE1002-Unit1/)
A summary for Unit 1 of my Biorenewable Resources class. The ones labeled BBE 1002 were for assignments, but I think it's really great information!

### Tutorials
